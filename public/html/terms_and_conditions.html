                Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
                secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
                which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
                by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
                vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                security features and it could mean that the WUW app won’t work properly or at

                that there are certain things that Marino Trejos will not take responsibility
                for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile
                network provider, but Marino Trejos cannot take responsibility for the app not
                working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                have any of your data allowance left.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

                outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
                with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
                charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
                connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the
                app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
                data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
                country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for
                the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
                you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</span></p>

                Marino Trejos cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
                i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Marino Trejos cannot

                updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
                information to us so that we can make it available to you. Marino Trejos

                the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to
                extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download
                the updates if you want to keep using the app. Marino Trejos does not promise

                with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device.
                However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
                to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it

                will be immediately deposited to the driver's bank account at the moment of accepting
                the request, so that money is delivered to the user in a WUW envelope.<br>
                Each driver is obliged to have his vehicle in optimal conditions to provide the

                drivers who are involved. For this reason, it will be mandatory that your
                insurance policy is always up to date as well as the registration of your
                vehicle. Personnel who use our service in urban areas and transport by bicycles

                which we provide our customers the ease of processing their money from their
                personal bank accounts through payment gateways, delivering the money from
                their bank to their homes or workplaces. This prevents  our customers from
                going to a bank or ATM.  This service will be delivered through drivers
                affiliated with our application, which have been selected carefully in order to
                provide a safe, friendly and professional service for each of our users. This

                safe as well as the delivery of money to the place where it is requested in the
                application. Each customer will be constantly notified, through the
                application, of each step that is carried out until it is delivered securely,
                at the money's desired destination.  The user must show the driver a secret
                code that will be generated automatically by the application so that the money
                is correctly delivered to the right person requesting the service. Each person
                that performs the service as a customer is obliged to verify if the correct
                amount of money was delivered to them. If the customer does not follow through
                with that, WUW will not be subject to claims from the user. WUW will be open to
                resolve any claim, as soon as the claim is made about our service, it will be
                investigated and we will come to a conclusion about what should be done about
                the situation.</span></p>
